Title:- Enhanced Network Security through Port Restriction on Switches (Access Control) in Cisco Packet Tracer by Configuring different VLANs

Description:-

	Suppose there are two different types of team in your company team A and team B and there should be protocol for denial of communication between Team A and Team B, Team A members can only communicate with other Team A member and same goes for Team B. Configure different VLANs for 2 team and deny the communication.

Objective:-

	-Implement port restriction access control to enhance network security.
	-Design a scalable and efficient network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.
	-Ensure seamless communication while restricting unauthorized access to specific ports.

Components:-

	-Cisco switches (models, quantity)
	-VLAN configurations
	-Access Control Lists (ACLs) for port restriction
	-Network topology layout

Features:-

	-Improved network security
	-Efficient traffic management
	-Easy scalability
	-Compliance with industry security standards

Implementation Steps:-

	-make a topology with switch as a central communicator
	-Define VLANs for different departments.
	-Configure ACLs to restrict access to specific ports.
	-Test the network to ensure proper functionality.
	-Document configurations for future reference.

Benefits:-
	
	-Strengthened network security
	-Minimized risk of unauthorized access
	-Improved network performance and efficiency
	-Easy maintenance and troubleshooting
